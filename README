DESCRIBE YOUR CODE HERE AND DESIGN DECISIONS YOU MADE

__________________________________________________________________________

Instructions to run:
1)open a terminal on the current directory
	$ make
2)the makefile generates proxy.out
3)run and specify port number as command line argument, as shown
	$ ./proxy.out <port>
4)Now the proxy server is up and running... open a new terminal window on the same directory
5)use telnet to get websites, as folllowing
	$ telnet localhost <port>
	GET http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/ HTTP/1.0 <press double enter>
6) can use multiple similar terminal windows for concurrecy check 
7)can also run the python scripts proxy_test to check, run as
	$ python proxy_tester.py 127.0.0.1 <port>
  			or
	$ python proxy_tester_conc.py 127.0.0.1 <port>

Implemented proxy.c 

1)When proxy starts, it establishes a socket connection that it listens for incoming connections. The proxy listens on the port specified from the command line and waits for incoming client connections.
2)The parsing library is used
3)For every client, we fork a new process, which has file descriptors for the TCP stream, whereas parent process keeps waiting for further requests.
4)if parsing is successful, we open a connection to hostname mentioned in request, and pass-on the received data to the client, now the connection is closed and the forked child  exits.
